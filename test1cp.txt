Since June 2022 till date (20 months) I am not receiving any interest amount as promised and I am not receiving any update from B. Sanjeevi Kumar/V.Theriselvam.

Please refer to documents(bond paper) and transaction receipts related to above ten lakh investment in IFS.

Kindly do the payment as promised or do settle my principal amount as soon as possible which has been invested in IFS through B.Sanveevi Kumar to V.Theriselvam.

Honestly, I have invested money in IFS by taking personal loans and borrowing some amount with friends and I am unable to pay my EMI's and friends interest amount since the last 20 months because I am not receiving any amount from IFS.
Due to pressure from bank and friends calls i mentally disturbed a lot and unable to survive.

Please take into account my suffering and settle my amount before committing suicide.


Thank you for the understanding.
